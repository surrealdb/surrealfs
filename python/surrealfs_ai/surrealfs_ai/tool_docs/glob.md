Glob

Match filesystem paths using a glob pattern (e.g., `src/**/*.rs`). Patterns are resolved against the current working directory unless an absolute path is provided. Results are returned newest-first.

Usage: provide a single pattern. Use `**` for recursive matches; literal separators are respected.
